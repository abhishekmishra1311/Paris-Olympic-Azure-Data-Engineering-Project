Olympic 2024 data using various tools and technologies, including Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks
Workflow


The project workflow follows this sequence:

Data Source → Collect data from various sources.

Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory) → Transfer raw data into Azure.

Raw Data Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen2) → Store unprocessed data securely.

Data Transformation (Azure Databricks) → Clean, process, and transform the data.

Transformed Data Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen2) → Save processed data for further analysis.

Analytics & Processing (Azure Synapse Analytics) → Perform advanced data analysis.

Visualization & Reporting (Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio) → Create interactive dashboards.

## Introduction
The Paris Olympic Azure Data Engineering Project is designed to process and analyze data related to the 2024 Paris Olympics using modern cloud-based technologies. By leveraging Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Azure Synapse Analytics, and data pipelines, this project ensures efficient data ingestion, transformation, and visualization. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains historical and real-time information on Olympic events, athletes, medals, and country-wise performance.
